      <p>
        The main idea of creating this webshop site was to practice the basics
        of React and learn React Hooks. In order to do that I wanted to create a
        place where I would like to buy myself. Where shopping is easy and
        enjoyable.
      </p>
      <h2>Some more</h2>
      <p>
        I have learned a lot by creating this site. First of all, perseverance
        in creating the project and how much time the details can take. I
        learned what React Hooks are and how to use them. I also learned how to
        use Firebase and how to use the database more smoothly.

      <h2>And more</h2>

        Propably not worth reading, I will put here some lorem ipsum to lengthen
        this paragraph. Snowboarding is a recreational activity and Winter
        Olympic and Paralympic sport that involves descending a snow-covered
        slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a riders feet.
